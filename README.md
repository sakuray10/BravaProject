Take Home Project for Brava

This is a rough recreation of Craigslist. On the homepage, the only functional tab at the moment is the "Community" tab.
Please navigate to the "Community" tab, and create a new posting. You should then be able to add a posting and then view the post. 

The posting is stored on an SQLite database. The website is created using the Python Flask framework, and some of the stylistic 
elements are cretead using Bootstrap. 

I would like to cite <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-web-application-using-flask-in-python-3> as the major resource I used n creating this prototype.
